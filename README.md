# yuni_bot
An utility discord bot for Clan Battle in Princess Connect Re:dive!
List of commands:
-!rsv: reserves any numbers of bosses, from 1 to 6 (6 is carryover).
-!fin: removes any nunmber of reserved bosses, from 1 to 6.
-!ment: mentions all the users in queue for a boss, from 1 to 6.
-!reserv: posts a list of all the bosses and all the users queued for each one.
-!name_boss: changes a boss name: !name_boss (boss_id) (boss_name).
-!clean: removes all the reservations, only mods can use this command (you'll need to replace the role id for your server's role).
-!good: this bot works very hard, let her know she's doing a great job!
